        <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
<p>I am a Computer Science student at the University of Dundee. As a mathematical person, I love <strong>problem-solving</strong> and also communicating with others. I am also quite entrepreneurial and am looking on starting an E-commerce brand in the future. In addition, I am a very religious person who loves volunteering. I understand that optimal customer satisfaction is the most important aspect, <em>so that is what I strive for in everything that I do professionally.</em></p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <h3>Support Cafe Volunteer</h3>
        <h4><a href="http://www.taughtbymuhammad.com/">Taught By Muhammad Charity</a> - Dundee, Angus</h4>
        <p>I volunteer at a weekly support cafe to offer complimentary hot, cafe-type food and drink to the local community (particularly the elderly and underprivileged members of the community) in a cafe environment. Some of the customers may have some disability that affects their ability to speak so the role requires some patience sometimes when communicating with them. As part of this role, I serve customers, socialise and converse with them, as well as preparing food and drinks for them, while ensuring health measures put in place are being followed. Most importantly, I ensure that there is optimal customer satisfaction, that any problems or issues they have, are solved to the best of my ability, that the customers enjoy the meal they are given and that they are in a relaxing, amicable, and comfortable environment, where they feel free to share a humorous, light-hearted and trouble-free experience with the staff and other customers.</p>

        <h3>Freelance Online Tutor</h3>
        <p>I tutor <strong>Physics, and Chemistry</strong> up to <strong>National 5 level</strong> and <strong>Maths</strong> up to <strong>Scottish Higher level</strong>. Having delivered over 100 hours worth of online lessons, I always ensure that each lesson is personalised to the student's individual needs. My main priority is to ensure that the student receives great value from the lessons and they are completely satisfied with the service that I provide. Often, I find that my students do not understand the content from my first explanation. I, therefore, must improvise and adapt to be able to explain it in a way that they understand it. This requires creativity and problem-solving skills. It also requires quick thinking. If they have any issues or problems, I am more than happy to spend that little bit extra time with them to ensure that those issues are resolved before I conclude the lesson.</p>
